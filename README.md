# ParticleSim
Web browser particle simulation exercise

##Usage
By default, the simulation shows a snowfall. Click the blue and white buttons to switch between Rainfall and Snowfall, respectively.

## About the Implementation
###How to run ParticleSim
Open ParticleSim.html in your web browser. The implementation is entirely contained within that file, and has been tested for compatability with current builds of:
1. Chrome
2. Firefox
3. Edge
ParticleSim contains functions for creating Particles and Buttons, which should allow for ease of adding new particles and buttons to select them.

## Why ParticleSim?
While I have worked in web development professionally, I haven't had a chance to play with some of the newer HTML5 features - I felt this  was a good reason to learn about HTML5's Canvas.
